# Posemo -- PostgreSQL Secure Monitoring

Posemo is a open source PostgreSQL monitoring backend system, which can
collect a lot of PostgreSQL internals in a secure way without superuser
access.

For an overview, see the README.md in the main directory 
or the L<GitHub repository|https://github.com/alvar-freude/Posemo>.

If you view this on GitHub, the following links may go to a CPAN site 
instead of local documentation. B<Until released on CPAN, the links are broken!>, 
and when released they may be older then the development version in the repository.

**Hint:** On GitHub, the links in the file ``Manual.pod`` (link above) point to external 
and currently not existing files (until Posemo is released on CPAN); use the following 
links instead.
