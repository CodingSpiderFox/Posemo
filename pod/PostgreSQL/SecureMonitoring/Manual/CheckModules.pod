=head1 Posemo Developer Manual: How to write Check Modules

This manual is about writing check modules for Posemo. This documentation is work in 
progress â€“ if you miss something, L<open a issue at GitHub|https://github.com/alvar-freude/Posemo/issues/new> 
or L<write me a mail|mailto:alvar@a-blast.org>.


=head2 Overview

Writing check modules is simple and easy. Often you only have to write some 
SQL, define the return type, maybe some other attributes and the Posemo sugar 
makes everything else for you.

Each check generates a PostgreSQL function, which encapsulates your code. 
You can write the check in every L<proceducal language|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/xplang.html>, 
default is simply L<SQL|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/xfunc-sql.html>.

Since Posemo is written in fully OO-Perl with L<Moose|Moose>, you usually have 
full access to all Moose features. For most checks, you don't need to write Perl code, only SQL.

Each check module is a subclass of L<PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks|PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks> 
and you can use and override each method or add something with all Moose method modifiers. E.g. when 
you want to change the behaviour of the C<execute> method.

Or, in other words: each check module is a B<Perl and Moose class>. Often they 
look like configuration files, but they simply are Perl classes, where you can do 
everything you can do in L<Moose|Moose> classes. Therefore it is very flexible and extensible.

Each check module should return generic values, independently from the frontend or 
monitoring system which displays the results.


=head2 Examples

You can use all the check modules in C<lib/PostgreSQL/SecureMonitoring/Checks> as examples.


=head3 Simple Example

A minimalistic check module looks like this:

   package PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks::SimpleAlive; # by Default, the name of the check is built from this package name
   
   use PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::ChecksHelper;            # enables Moose, exports sugar functions; enables strict&warnings
   extends "PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks";            # We extend our base class ::Checks
   
   check_has code => "SELECT true";                           # This is our check SQL!
   
   1;                                                         # every Perl module must return (end with) a true value


So, in the first line there is the name of the Perl package. As usual, this B<must> 
be the same as the file and path name, but with C<::> instead of C</> and 
without the file extension.

In line 3, the module uses the Posemo Checks helper module. This enables 
everything from L<Moose|Moose> (including L<strict|strict> and L<warnings|warnings>!), 
like you type C<use Moose;>, and one additional sugar function with 
the name C<check_has>. With this you can set every attribute 
of the base class C<PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks>. See below for a list 
of all attributes.

In line 4, C<PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks> is defined via Moose as base 
class, our module inherits everything from that. See the L<Moose::Manual|Moose Manual> 
for more documentation about moose.

In line 6, all check attribbutes are defined. The only attribbute (which must be 
set by every check module) is the code. If you have a very special case, you might 
want to override the C<_build_code> method instead.


You can manually call the generated check function like this:

   monitoring=> SELECT * FROM simple_alive();
    alive
   -------
    t
   (1 row)


(This here is only an example, Posemo does not really have a "SimpleAlive" check, but a check called "Alive")



=head3 Example with return type

The following example is from the C<Slave Lag> check. Here in this documentation only 
the C<check_has> command is mentioned (see above for everything around or the real code 
for full file with user documentation):

   check_has
      description => 'When the server is a slave, then return the replication lag in seconds.',
      return_type => 'double precision',
      result_unit => 's',
      code        => "SELECT CASE WHEN pg_is_in_recovery()
                                  THEN extract(EPOCH FROM clock_timestamp() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp())
                                  ELSE NULL
                                  END
                             AS slave_lag;";

Here you can see that more attributes beside the C<code> are defined:

C<description> is a short description of the check. Each check should have a description!

C<return_type> defines the return type of the SQL function. This is passed directly to 
PostgreSQL. It is also used as the default C<result_type>. Default C<return_type> is C<boolean>, 
where true means "OK" and false a failure.

C<result_unit> is forwarded as is to the frontend via the output module. It should be displayed in the frontend.

C<code> is, as usual, the SQL for the check. Each column (here: only one) should have a name, which 
is displayed by the frontend.


=head3 Example with multiple return values

A check may return multiple values in one row. Here is an example from the check C<CheckpointTime>:

   check_has
      description       => "Checkpoint write and sync duration.",
      result_type       => "double precision",
      result_unit       => "ms",
      result_is_counter => 1,
      graph_type        => "stacked_area",
      
      # complex return type
      return_type => q{
         write_time    double precision,
         sync_time     double precision
         },
      
      code => "SELECT checkpoint_write_time, checkpoint_sync_time FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;";


Beside some new attributes, you can see a complex return type here, containing two 
values (C<write_time> and C<sync_time>). (Here it is defined with the Perl quoting operator C<q>, 
which is the same as C<'>, but takes every character or bracket as seperator, in this case C<{> and C<}>. )

Posemo recognises that the C<return_type> is more than one value and internally builds a special 
SQL-Type for this, which is set as return data type. The C<code> must return the same types, 
here two double precision values.

New attributes introduced in this example:


C<result_is_counter>: this flag (boolean) is an information for output and display modules that the value 
is not an absolute value, but an incremental counter. Here it is the total checkpoint write and sync time.

C<graph_type>: this defines how the performance data should be rendered, here as a stacked area graph.


A result of this check may look like this, when you manually call the internally generated check function:

   monitoring=> SELECT * FROM checkpoint_time();
    write_time | sync_time
   ------------+-----------
    3334228328 |    101053
   (1 row)


=head3 Multiline example

Here is a more complex example, which gives a multiline result.

It is the code from the C<CacheHitRatio> check, which gives one row for each database, 
one summary row and one value per row.

   has skip_db_re => ( is => "ro", isa => "Str", );
   
   check_has
      description          => 'Get cache hit ratio',
      has_multiline_result => 1,
      result_unit          => q{%},
      result_type          => "real",
      arguments            => [ [ skip_db_re => 'TEXT', '^template[01]$' ], ],
      min_value            => 0,
      max_value            => 100,
      warning_level        => 80,
      critical_level       => 60,
      lower_is_worse       => 1,
      
      # complex return type
      return_type => q{
         database                        VARCHAR(64),
         cache_hit_ratio                 REAL
         },
      
      code => q{
         WITH ratio AS
            (
            SELECT datname::VARCHAR(64) AS database,
                   blks_read,
                   blks_hit,
                   CASE WHEN blks_hit = 0
                      THEN 0
                      ELSE 100::float8*blks_hit::float8/(blks_read+blks_hit)
                   END AS cache_hit_ratio
              FROM pg_stat_database
             WHERE ( CASE WHEN length(skip_db_re) > 0 THEN datname !~ skip_db_re ELSE true END )
          ORDER BY database
            )
          SELECT '!TOTAL' AS database,
                 CAST(
                      (
                      CASE WHEN sum(blks_hit) = 0
                        THEN 0
                        ELSE 100::float8*sum(blks_hit)::float8/(sum(blks_read)+sum(blks_hit))
                      END
                      ) AS real)
                     AS cache_hit_ratio
            FROM ratio
          UNION ALL
          SELECT database, cache_hit_ratio::real FROM ratio;
         };


At the start, we see the definition of an additional attribute C<skip_db_re>. This is a normal L<Moose attribute|Moose::Manual::Attributes>, 
which can be set in a config for this check. You can define everything you need and decide, 
if you want to pass this to the check SQL function. This attribute is read only (ro), and "is a" datatype "Str", 
so it accepts any string.

Here C<skip_db_re> stands for I<regular expression for skipping databases>. See below for Multiline best practices. 
You can set this attribute in the config file for this check:


   <Check CacheHitRatio>
     skip_db_re = "(^template[01]|_backup)$"
   </Check>

This skips template0 and template1 and all databases ending with _backup. 
The regular expression is a PostgreSQL regular expression as used in the SQL!


The new attribute C<arguments> for C<check_has> defines, which arguments are 
passed to the SQL function. You can pass every class attribute, but usually you should define 
your own like above.
 
It takes an array reference of array references, which elements define the argument 
name, its SQL data type and the default value:


   arguments => [ [ skip_db_re => 'TEXT',    '^template[01]$' ], ],
   #            ^   ^              ^          ^
   #            |   |              |          |
   #            |   argument name  |          Default value
   #            |                  SQL data type
   #            Open outer (and inner) arrayref


See below for details.



A result of this check may look like this, when you manually call the internally generated check function:

   monitoring=> SELECT * FROM cache_hit_ratio();
       database     | cache_hit_ratio
   -----------------+-----------------
    !TOTAL          |         99.9925
    elephant        |         99.9911
    mammut          |         99.9896
    postgres        |         99.9993
    zebra           |         99.9991
   (5 rows)



=head4 Multiline Results: Best Practices

If you create multiline results which give one row for each database, you really B<should> do it 
in the same way as the above example and all other Posemo checks do it:

=over 4

=item 1.

The first column should always contain a row title: the database name or other titles
like "table name", "user name" or something similar. All other columns take the 
values for this database (or table, user, â€¦) (which in the above example is only 
one value, the C<cahe_hit_ratio>).

=item 2.

Define an attribute C<skip_db_re> with default C<^template[01]$>
and use this attribute in your SQL to filter out unwanted databases. 
If your title is something else, like a table or user, use C<skip_table_re> or C<skip_user_re> or 
something similar depending on your title.


=item 3.

The first row should return the sum of all databases (tables, users, â€¦). 
You can use a <L Common Table Expression|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html> 
(CTE, C<WITH>-Statement) together with a C<UNION> like in the example above.

=item 4.

The following rows contain the values for each database (table, user or other title) 
with the database (table, user, ...) name in the fist column.

=back


Hint: to write a check that reads something from a specific 
database, you can not use such an attribute to define the database.
You have to configure a connection to this database instead â€“ see the configuration manual.

=head3 Example with arguments, install_sql and writing to DB

This example is an excerpt from the C<Writeable> check. The real check has some more 
code for overriding the C<execute> method, timeout handling and more, which 
doesn't matter here.

   # Extra attribute declaration
   # attribute message with it's builder MUST be declared lazy,
   # because builder method uses other attributes!
   # Retention_period has no default, because the default is encoded 
   # in the SQL function definition via the "arguments" attribute

   has retention_period => ( is => "ro", isa => "Str", predicate => "has_retention_period", );
   has message          => ( is => "ro", isa => "Str", builder   => "_build_message", lazy => 1, predicate => "has_message", );

   check_has
      description    => 'Only incomplete example.',
      volatility     => "VOLATILE",                   # Our check modifies the database ...
      has_writes     => 1,                            # ... and needs a commit.
      arguments => [ [ message => 'TEXT' ], [ retention_period => 'INTERVAL', '1 day' ], ],
      code      => q{
            DELETE FROM writeable WHERE age(statement_timestamp(), date_inserted) > retention_period;
            INSERT INTO writeable VALUES (message) RETURNING true;
         },
      install_sql => q{
            CREATE TABLE            writeable (message text, date_inserted TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now());
            REVOKE ALL           ON writeable FROM PUBLIC;
            REVOKE ALL           ON writeable FROM current_user;
            GRANT INSERT, DELETE ON writeable TO   current_user;
          };
   
   # Create a default message from the host names
   sub _build_message
      {
      my $self   = shift;
      my $dbhost = $self->host // "<local>";
      my $myhost = hostname;
      return "Written by $myhost to $dbhost via ${ \$self->name }";
      }

In the code, the argument C<retention_period> and C<message> are used like a 
normal argument to a function.

Beside this, the check is volatile (attribute C<volatility>) because it writes 
something and indicates that it needs a C<COMMIT> via C<has_writes>. And it has
some extra SQL, defined in C<install_sql>. The default message is build in 
Perl with access to other attribbutes (C<host> and C<name>). therefore there is 
a builder method. Instead the C<message> attribute builder method, it would be 
possible to write method called C<message> with the same content. The difference 
is, that with builder method the result is reused in this instance. Since the 
code is usually only called once, this is only a question of style. 


=head3 More Examples

You can view the source of all main Posemo check modules and take them as examples.



=head2 List of Attributes

C<check_has> accepts a lot of attributes, which are full Moose attributes. You can define them 
in C<check_has>, but also use them when overriding some of the methods of 
L<PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks|PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks>.

Some attributes can be configured in the config file, either globally, by host, 
by hostgroup or by check.

TODO: group by types of attributes. (Maybe: put description of C<arguments> in own 
chapter, then the description in the list here can be short.)


=over 4

=item * B<class>

The complete class name of the current object. Usually read-only, 
built by the C<_build_class> method in L<PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks|PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks>.


=item * B<name>

The name of the current check. It is automatically generated from C<class>.

Sometimes you might want to define the check name by yourself, e.g. when the 
autogenerated name is wrong or misleading. The name should be like the last part of the class name.


=item * B<description>

Define here a short description of this check.


=item * B<code>

The most important attribute: define here the code for your check.

If you have to access other attributes inside the SQL (like the schema name), 
you should override the _build_code method instead.


=item * B<install_sql>

Some additional SQL, which will be executed at install time before the function is created.

You B<must> set proper access rights if you create some objects like tables (see example above).

You may override C<_build_install_sql> instead.

=item * B<sql_function>

In this attribute, the complete SQL function is stored (by the C<_build_sql_function> method). 
In very rare situations you may write it by your own or override (or modify) the build method. But usually 
you should not do this, because in this case you have to do much things manually! 


=item * B<sql_function_name>

The name of the SQL function, which will be generated for this check.

Normally the name of the generated SQL function is generated from the check name. 
You may change it here to some other value. Usually you should not change this attribute!


=item * B<result_type>

The data type of the result. For the output modules and frontends. By default the same as the C<return_type>.

You may set an explicit C<result_type> if it differs from the C<return_type>, e.g. when the C<return_type> is multi-column.


=item * B<order>

You may set an execution order for your check. This is an alphanumerical (string) value.

Default: Name of the check.


=item * B<return_type>

The SQL return type of the generated function.

If Posemo recognises that the return type is more than one value, it internally builds a special 
SQL Type for it, which is set as return data type. The C<code> must return the same types.

See the existing check modules and above for examples.


=item * B<result_unit>

Information for the output module and frontend about the result unit. Typical values
are C<s> for seconds, C<ms> for millilseconds, C<%> for percent, ...

Default: empty string

Hint: Usually you should return bytes instead ob megabytes etc. and let the frontend manage the display.


=item * B<language>

The language used by your code for the function body. Default: C<sql>.

You can use any language available in the PostgreSQL installation. For common checks, it's recommended 
to use SQL (default) or PL/pgSQL by setting the language attribute to C<plpgsql>. The value is passed 
directly to the C<LANGUAGE> attribute of the C<CREATE FUNCTION> statement.


=item * B<volatility>

The I<volatility> classification of the generated SQL function. Default: C<STABLE>.

You should set this according the L<PostgreSQL Function Volatility Categories|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/xfunc-volatility.html>.

Typically - when you don't write anything - you will use the default and take C<VOLATILE> 
when modifying something in the database, e.g. inserting some rows, as the C<Writeable> check does.


=item * B<has_multiline_result>

A flag, indicating if the code (may) return multiple rows. Default: false.

Set this to 1 if you return multiple rows.

Hint: When returning multiple rows, the first column B<should> contain a
title for this row, like a database name.


=item * B<has_writes>

A flag, indicating if the code writes something to the database. Default: false.

You B<must> set it to 1, if you update/insert/delete/... something.

When set to 1, Posemo calls a C<COMMIT> after running the check.


=item * B<arguments>

With the attribute C<arguments> you can declare some arguments which are passed to the function.

Earch argument has a name, a SQL data type and optionally a default value, which is 
included in the function definition. You can define any number of arguments. 
They are passed as named argument to the function.

Example:

   check_has
      # [â€¦]
      arguments => [
                      [ timeout    => 'INTEGER', 1000 ],
                      [ skip_db_re => 'TEXT',    '^template[01]$' ],
                   ],
      # [â€¦]

C<arguments> takes a arrayref of arrayrefs as parameter. In Perl 5,
each arrayref is separated by C<[> and C<]>.

The inner arrayref

  [ timeout => 'INTEGER', 1000 ]

contains one attribute definition: argument name is "timeout", data type 
is "INTEGER" and the default value is 1000.


Each argument must be an attribute or method in your check (callable as 
C<$obj_of_your_check-E<gt>argument_name>). Therefore you should declare these  
attributes in your class (remember: each check is a Perl Moose class!):

   has timeout    => ( is => "ro", isa => "Int", );   # the "timeout" attribute is a integer
   has skip_db_re => ( is => "ro", isa => "Str", );   # the skip db regexpt is a string

Alternativelly you can also write a method with the name of the argument instead, e.g.:

   sub timeout 
      {
      my $self = shift;
      return $self->critical_level * 1000;
      }

For more or less static arguments like a timeout, it is more elegant to write a 
builder method and declare an attribute like this:

   has timeout => ( is => "ro", isa => "Int", builder   => "_build_timeout", lazy => 1, );
   [â€¦]
   sub _build_timeout
      {
      my $self = shift;
      return $self->critical_level * 1000;
      }

You can use any feature of Moose attributes or Moose in general. 


C<arguments> takes a array reference of array reference, e.g.:

   arguments => [
                   [ skip_db_re => 'TEXT',    '^template[01]$' ],
                   [ timeout    => 'INTEGER', 1000 ],
                 ],


Here we have two arguments for the check funcion:

C<skip_db_re>, which is of SQL type C<TEXT> and has the default value C<'^template[01]$'>.

C<timeout> is of type C<INTEGER> and has the default value 1000.

Inside the PostgreSQL function, you can access the argument like usual. 
If the Language is SQL e.g. like this:

   [â€¦]
   WHERE ( CASE WHEN length(skip_db_re) > 0 THEN datname !~ skip_db_re ELSE true END )
   [â€¦]

When C<skip_db_re> is empty, then nothing is skipped, else it depends if the regexp patches.



In the config file, you can set the defined attributes, but also all default attributes too:

  # example for setting check attributes in config file 
  <Check MyTestCheck>
    timeout        = 100,
    skip_db_re     = "^(template[01]|unwanted_db|other_unwanted_db)$"
    
    # Additional other attributes (available by default in all checks)
    warning_level  = 1000
    critical_level = 2000
  </Check>


=item * B<result_is_counter>

A flag, indicating that the result is a counter, an (ever) raising value like 
accumulated time or I/O. A frontend should display the rate by timerange (usually seconds). 

This value is not used internally, only forwarded to the output module.

Default: off/disabled.

=item * B<graph_type>

A check module can define a graph type for the frontend. 
Valid values are: line, area, stacked_area. 

An output module should handle this. This value is not used internally, only forwarded to the output module.

Default: empty.


=item * B<graph_mirrored>

A flag, indicating that the graph should be mirrored at the null level. 
Usually this is used for input/output graphs or similar. 
For instance, it is used for committed/rolled back transactions in the 
C<Transactions> check.

This value is not used internally, only forwarded to the output module.

Default: off/false; set it to 1 (true), if you want to enable this for your checks.


=item * B<enabled>

A flag, indicating if the check is enabled or disabled. 

Usually all checks are enabled by default. But maybe you want 
to disable some checks by default and enable them in the config. 

When you write a check for an application, e.g. counting NextCloud users, 
then this check should be disabled by default and only enabled on request 
for a specific database and host.

Default: enabled (1).

May be changed in configuration.


=item * B<warning_level, critical_level>

Numerical threshold values of the critical and warning levels. The default C<test_critical_warning> 
method uses this to test if the result is critical or warning.

By default, all result values are tested.
For multiline checks, the first column (the row title, see above) is skipped.

If you need other tests, override tht C<test_critical_warning> method (see below).

Default: none. No test for critcal and warning values.

May be changed in configuration.


=item * B<lower_is_worse>

By default, C<test_critical_warning> tests if the result values are bigger than the thresholds 
in C<warning_level> and C<critical_level>. When the flag C<lower_is_worse> is set, 
this is reversed. You can use this when a lower value should trigger a warning or critical message, 
e.g. for cache hit ratio in the C<CacheHitRatio> check: lower hit ratio is obviously worse than higher one.

Default: off.


=item * B<min_value, max_value>

Usable as a hint for the displaying frontend. E.g., set it to 0 and 100 for percent values.

These values are not used internally, only forwarded to the output module.

Default: none.

May be changed in configuration.

=head2 Overriding Methods

Usually you don't need to override the buildin methods. So, don't fear the code here, 
if you are a SQL but no Perl developer. You B<can> do this in special conditions.

All checks are subclasses of L<PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks|PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring::Checks>. 
You can override all methods of this class, but typically you may want to override or modify 
C<test_critical_warning>, C<execute>, C<_build_code> and C<_build_install_sql>. C<execute> should only be modified 
with a L<Moose method modifier|Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers>; when modifying with C<around>, the original 
method should be called.

For complete examples, see the checks C<Primary>, C<Alive> and C<Writeable>.


=head3 Example: override C<test_critical_warning>

This example is from the C<Primary> check:

   has is_primary   => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );
   has isnt_primary => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );
   
   check_has
      description => 'Checks if server is primary (master) not (secondary, slave).',
      code        => "SELECT not pg_is_in_recovery() AS primary;";
   
   sub test_critical_warning
      {
      my $self   = shift;
      my $result = shift;
      
      if ( $self->is_primary and not $result )
         {
         $result->{message}  = "Failed ${ \$self->name } for host ${ \$self->host_desc }: not a primary (master).";
         $result->{critical} = 1;
         return;
         }
      
      if ( $self->isnt_primary and $result )
         {
         $result->{message}
            = "Failed ${ \$self->name } for host ${ \$self->host_desc }: it is a primary (master), not secondary (slave) as requested.";
         $result->{critical} = 1;
         return;
         }
      
      return;
      } ## end sub test_critical_warning

Here the original C<test_critical_warning> is overridden by a special method, 
which does the check according two new attributes, which may be configured in the config.

   has is_primary   => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );
   has isnt_primary => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );

Example config to force a master (primary) server: 

   <Check Primary>
     # fail, when host is no primary (master)
     is_primary = 1
   </Check>

The result hahshref is changed in the C<test_critical_warning> method when the conditions are met. 


=head3 Example: modify C<execute>

The C<Alive> check is an example for a method modifier at execute.

The main code looks like:

   [â€¦]
   has no_critical    => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );
   has warn_if_failed => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );
   
   check_has                                          # Without catching the error, 
      description => 'Checks if server is alive.',    # ... this here would be everything 
      code        => "SELECT true";
   
   around execute => sub {                            # modify the execute method
      my $orig = shift;
      my $self = shift;
      
      my $result;
      eval {                                          # catch errors
         $result = $self->$orig();                    # Call original execute method here
         return 1;
         } or do
         {                                            # when failed, then set fail messages and build result.
         $result->{result}   = 0;
         $result->{row_type} = "single";
         $result->{message}  = "Failed Alive check for host ${ \$self->host_desc }; error: $EVAL_ERROR";
         $result->{critical} = 1 unless $self->no_critical;
         $result->{warning}  = 1 if $self->warn_if_failed;
         };
      
      return $result;
      
      sub test_critical_warning { return; }
   };
   [â€¦]


At the beginning, it calls the original execute method inside C<eval> and therefore 
catches all exceptions, e.g. connection errors.

In the do-block, the result is build manually, when the check execution failed. 
This also uses two attributes, which must be declared:

   has no_critical    => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );
   has warn_if_failed => ( is => "ro", isa => "Bool", );

So the behaviour can be changed in the configuration, here for instance to 
give a warning (instead critical) when there are connection errors and 
other hard errors. 

Because C<test_critical_warning> change the result, this method must be overridden 
with a emty method:

   sub test_critical_warning { return; }

It would be possible to set an internal attribute with the error message 
instead doing everything in the do block above and write the logic into a 
C<test_critical_warning> method.



=head2 Return values

=head3 Recommended return values

Your check can theoretically return every value(s) you can imagine. It's possible to 
return complex things with a JSON data structure or something else. 
B<Usually you should not do this!>

The reason is simple: B<Your return values should be generic and usable by every frontend.> 
You should not return a result like C<critical> by your check SQL itself, because it usually doesn't 
know the thresholds etc. Instead, use the builtin C<test_critical_warning> method 
or write your own and override it. If you want to return a list of texts 
(e.g. "unused indexes") besides a counter, you should override the C<execude> method, 
change the result and set the C<message> inside the result in C<test_critical_warning>.


=head2 Documentation

Every check module should have some documentation in L<Pod format|perlpod>. 
If a check module is part of the main Posemo distribution, this is tested by the tests.

Each check must have the following sections for surviving the tests (see the other check modules for examples).

=over 4

=item * B<NAME>

The Name of your module and a short description. When the documentation is rendered as HTML, 
this is the title and/or description for search sites etc.


=item * B<SYNOPSIS>

A short synopsis for the configuration, including your check specific configuration options (attributes).

When there is nothing special, mention this.

See the other check modules for examples.


=item * B<DESCRIPTION>

A short description about the check and which values/perfdata it returns.

You should describe all attributes which are not default and give examples for 
the config file options and for the results.


=back


You may add other sections, e.g. typical Perl documentation sections like AUTHOR etc. 
Your documentation should be short but complete ...


=head2 Testing

Each check module must have some tests. You can write them using
[pgTAP PostgreSQL extension](http://pgtap.org) ([pgTAP code on GitHub](https://github.com/theory/pgtap/)) 
and/or with the help of the C<Test::PostgreSQL::SecureMonitoring> module. This module 
gives you an old style and simple procedural interface. 

See the folder C<t> for examples.

B<TODO:> Write description and examples about testing.


=head2 Licenses, Publication

You can write your Check modules under any license you want. If they are not only 
for internal use, please make them public. The PostgreSQL License is preferred 
for integration into main Posemo.
