# Posemo – PostgreSQL Secure Monitoring

Posemo is a PostgreSQL monitoring framework, that can monitor everything in Postgres with an unprivileged user. Posemo conforms to the rules of the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI).

Posemo itself has no display capabilities, but can output the results for every monitoring environment (e.g. check_mk, Nagios, Zabbix, Icinga, …).
